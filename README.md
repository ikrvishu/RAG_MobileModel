Pipenv Installation and Configuration
1. Open the terminal in the current directory
2. In your terminal run pip install pipenv or depending on your environment, pip3 install pipenv
3. Inside your project directory, run the following command to install your dependencies from the Pipfile:
   pipenv install

4. Run the following command to create and enter a new environment:
   pipenv shell

After doing this your terminal will now be running commands in this new environment managed by Pipenv.

Once inside this shell, you can run Python commands just as shown in the lecture videos.
eg:
python main.py
